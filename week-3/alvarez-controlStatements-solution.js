=======================================*/


// Using 'for' statement
let number = '';


/*
My solution:
1. Added an open curly bracket, to declare the statement properly.
2. Added a plus sign (+), to increment the loop properly.
*/
for (let i = 0; i < 11; i++){
number += i + "\n";
}

// Output is numbers 0 - 10. Each in a new line.

/*
My solution:
3. Changed the Number variable in console log into small case 'n' because the variable declared is number and JavaScript is case sensitive.
*/
console.log(number);
